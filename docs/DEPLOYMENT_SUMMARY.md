## Technology Stack

- **Terraform**: v1.5.0+
- **Azure Provider (azurerm)**: v3.80+
- **Azure AD Provider (azuread)**: v2.45+
- **AzAPI Provider**: v1.10+ (for Entra Domain Services)
- **Random Provider**: v3.5+

## Architecture Components

1. **Resource Group**: Container for all Entra Domain Services resources
2. **Virtual Network**: Dedicated network with appropriate address space
3. **Subnets**: Dedicated subnet for Domain Services (with optional replica subnets)
4. **Network Security Groups**: Security rules for LDAP/LDAPS traffic
5. **Entra Domain Services**: Main managed domain service (using AzAPI)
6. **Key Vault**: Secure storage for certificates and passwords (optional)
7. **Log Analytics**: Centralized logging and monitoring
8. **Storage Account**: Backup storage for Enterprise SKU (optional)

## Deployment Prerequisites

### Required Permissions
- Azure Subscription: Contributor or Owner role
- Azure AD Tenant: Global Administrator permissions
- Ability to manage "AAD DC Administrators" group

### Required Configuration
- Valid domain name
- List of domain administrator users
- Network addressing plan

## Next Steps for Deployment

1. **Copy Configuration**: `cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars`
2. **Update Variables**: Edit `terraform.tfvars` with your specific values
3. **Initialize**: `terraform init`
4. **Plan**: `terraform plan`
5. **Deploy**: `terraform apply`
6. **Post-Deployment**: Configure DNS settings and test domain join

## Validation Status

✅ **Terraform Validate**: Configuration passes validation
✅ **Syntax Check**: All files are syntactically correct
✅ **Provider Integration**: AzAPI provider properly configured
✅ **Best Practices**: Follows Azure and Terraform best practices

## Cost Considerations

- **Standard SKU**: Lower cost, basic features
- **Enterprise SKU**: Higher cost, advanced features (filtered sync, backup)
- **Replica Sets**: Additional cost per region
- **Log Analytics**: Pay-per-GB ingestion and retention
- **Storage**: Backup storage costs for Enterprise SKU

## Security Notes

- Dedicated subnet required (no shared resources)
- Network Security Groups restrict access by default
- Key Vault used for sensitive data storage
- Diagnostic logging enabled for audit trails
- Supports secure LDAP with certificate management

This template provides a production-ready foundation for deploying Microsoft Entra Domain Services as a building block for authentication infrastructure in Azure.
